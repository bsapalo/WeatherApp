Please download the .zip file & start the project from index.jsp (CSS looks best in Google Chrome). WeatherApp implements a GoogleMaps API to give you the weather at any location in the world and an OpenWeather API to provide current weather data. WeatherApp was developed using HTML, JavaScript, CSS for the front-end and Java for the back-end. There is a SQL database which stores registered user information.

There is an issue in the login and register pages with the input text. Please click on the far left of the input text box so that you may type inside of it. My SQL code is included in the project directory.

Thank you for visiting!
